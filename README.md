Rationalized spending non-existant money

BUT it's not primarily a tech problem.

SpendLight focuses on identifying and correcting the thoughts and habits that lead to overspending.

Need to get a handle on what she's thinking when she decides to buy 5 dozen egges at a time for our family of 5.

So what does SpendLight provide.

1) It's specific.  We're looking for areas to improve, so we won't be vague.
Here I'm going to enter "Trader Joes" to reinforce the mental connection.

2) Second, it prompts you to rationalize and evaluate your spending.
Dollar amounts don't tell the story.  My wife can spend $80 at Costco and that can be wise spending.  Depending on the circumstances, that may have been 
really dumb.

3) It encourages discipline and patience.  Don't borrow from next weeks' budget.  Just wait.

4) Lastly, it's a team effort.  Realistically, you want to pair up a poor spender with a disciplined one.
